# Linked Building Data Ontologies

This page is created to gather ontologies related to the built environment domain. The aim of this library is to create a knowledge base of the most relevant ontologies for linked building data and to help researchers, students and professionals to find these ontologies easily. The page is contained by Alex Donkers (TU Eindhoven).

If you would like to add ontologies, please create an issue in the repository, including a link to the ontology, a short description and the category it belongs to.
