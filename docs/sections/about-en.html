<h2>About</h2><span class="markdown">
This page is created to gather ontologies related to the built environment domain. The aim of this library is to create a knowledge base of the most relevant ontologies for linked building data and to help researchers, students and professionals to find these ontologies easily. The page is contained by <a href="https://research.tue.nl/nl/persons/alex-ja-donkers">Alex Donkers</a> (<a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/design-and-decision-support-systems/information-systems-in-the-built-environment/">TU Eindhoven</a>).

If you would like to add ontologies, please <a href="https://github.com/AlexDonkers/LBDontologies/issues">create an issue</a> in the repository, including a link to the ontology, a short description and the category it belongs to.</span>
